I was born in Australia and have lived in every state at some point in my life, I have played guitar my entire life and was taught piano by my grandfather as a child. Despite my interest in computers and video games, I also love the outdoors and frequently go camping and love hiking. I also once managed to burn scrambled eggs while cooking.

This is an image I took while hiking in Japan.

### What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).

My particular interests in IT started when I was a child, my father worked for Telstra most of my young life and for his work we travelled around often, he was also an early adopter of the Web 2.0 and so I always had access to fast internet and new computers growing up. Changing schools so often meant I needed a way to keep in touch with the transient friends I made, in this sense I was lucky that Facebook and MSN became huge during my first years of high school. As I’ve gotten older I’ve also seen a darker side to social media, particularly in regards to privacy and security, for this reason, I am a sceptical large supporter of social media with a keen interest in Cybersecurity.

### Why did you choose to come to RMIT?

I first lived in Melbourne when I was very young and fell in love with the city, I had the choice to physically study at RMIT on campus but chose not to, Melbourne is many things but a cheap city it is not. I know several people living in Melbourne that work in Cybersecurity and the IT field and would love to finish my studies and find an internship there.

### What do you expect to learn during your studies?

I except to learn a large variety of skills, in another course I am creating a 2d game. Already I have learnt some Python in my own time, and I am currently learning C in another. I believe it is important to learn the fundamentals of IT before you can truly understand it.

### A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.

As I mentioned, I have a particular interest in Cybersecurity. I have always enjoyed solving puzzles and to me, pen-testing is much like puzzle solving, I also enjoy that much of pen-testing involves social engineering, a skill I find extremely interesting and one that I desire to learn more about. One of the required responsibilities is drive Cybersecurity staff recruitment as well as create awareness of the need for Cybersecurity – A skill I believe many people are lacking.

### A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.

There are a number of certifications that are required in IT and Cybersecurity is no different. The job suggests a willingness to pursue many of these certifications, including OSCP, SANS, CREST, MSCIPT, etc. From talking to multiple young Cybersecurity professionals and close friends, CompTIA security+ is a particularly necessary certification that opens many doors and one that I am personally studying for currently.

### A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.

I am currently lacking the professional skills and experience on paper but I have been in many (ethical) hacking circles for a long time and have a lot of personal experience and connections in this field.

### A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.

There are a few different skills and certifications I am currently pursuing, as mentioned above I am currently studying for the CompTIA security+ exam, in addition I have been fairly active on [Hackerrank.com](hackerrank.com). There are a number of certifications I believe I could pass at the current moment, but they are quite expensive and I am terrible in exams, so my first step is to overcome my exam anxiety – I will need to, as much of IT is keeping up with current certifications.
