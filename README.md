I was born in Australia and have lived in every state at some point in my life, I have played guitar my entire life and was taught piano by my grandfather as a child. Despite my interest in computers and video games, I also love the outdoors and frequently go camping and love hiking. I also once managed to burn scrambled eggs while cooking.

This is an image I took while hiking in Japan.
