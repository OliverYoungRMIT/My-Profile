I was born in Australia and have lived in every state at some point in my life, I have played guitar my entire life and was taught piano by my grandfather as a child. Despite my interest in computers and video games, I also love the outdoors and frequently go camping and love hiking. I also once managed to burn scrambled eggs while cooking.

This is an image I took while hiking in Japan.

### What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).

My particular interests in IT started when I was a child, my father worked for Telstra most of my young life and for his work we travelled around often, he was also an early adopter of the Web 2.0 and so I always had access to fast internet and new computers growing up. Changing schools so often meant I needed a way to keep in touch with the transient friends I made, in this sense I was lucky that Facebook and MSN became huge during my first years of high school. As I’ve gotten older I’ve also seen a darker side to social media, particularly in regards to privacy and security, for this reason, I am a sceptical large supporter of social media with a keen interest in Cybersecurity.

### Why did you choose to come to RMIT?

I first lived in Melbourne when I was very young and fell in love with the city, I had the choice to physically study at RMIT on campus but chose not to, Melbourne is many things but a cheap city it is not. I know several people living in Melbourne that work in Cybersecurity and the IT field and would love to finish my studies and find an internship there.

### What do you expect to learn during your studies?

I except to learn a large variety of skills, in another course I am creating a 2d game. Already I have learnt some Python in my own time, and I am currently learning C in another. I believe it is important to learn the fundamentals of IT before you can truly understand it.
